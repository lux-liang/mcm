\section{Factors Beyond Employment}

Employment alone understates AI's occupational impact. We assess wage dynamics, work quality, and holistic career viability.

\subsection{Wage Dynamics and Unit Labor Value Dilution}

AI affects wages through augmentation premium, substitution pressure, and skill premium:
\begin{equation}
w(t) = w_0 \cdot \left[\frac{\text{MPL}_{\text{aug}}(A)}{\text{MPL}_0} - \alpha_{\text{sub}} \cdot s(t) \cdot A(t) + \beta_{\text{skill}} \cdot V_s(t)\right]
\label{eq:wage_dynamics}
\end{equation}
where the substitution pressure term incorporates the dynamic substitution ratio $s(t)$ from Equation~\ref{eq:dynamic_subratio}. For Graphic Designers ($s_{\text{base}} = 0.55$), substitution cannibalization dominates the skill premium.

The paradoxical stagnation of Graphic Designers---employment growth of +0.2\% despite 85\% adoption---reflects \textbf{unit labor value dilution}: AI-augmented productivity gains dissipate through market saturation rather than accruing as wage growth. The Jevons-predicted demand expansion ($\varepsilon_D = 0.6$) proves insufficient to absorb the productivity-induced supply surge.

\subsection{Holistic Viability Assessment}

\begin{tabular}{lcccccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Occupation} & \textbf{$\Delta$Emp} & \textbf{$\Delta$Wage} & \textbf{Satisf.} & \textbf{Mobility} & \textbf{Task Shift} & \textbf{Overall} \\
\midrule
Info Security & +15.8\% & +14\% & +12\% & 9/10 & Log analysis $\to$ threat synthesis & \textbf{8.5/10} \\
Electricians & +2.6\% & +4\% & +2\% & 6/10 & Calculations $\to$ troubleshooting & \textbf{7.0/10} \\
Graphic Design & +0.2\% & $-4$\% & $-18$\% & 6/10 & Concept gen $\to$ creative direction & \textbf{4.8/10} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

When factors beyond employment are considered, Graphic Designer viability (4.8/10) falls well below Information Security (8.5/10), suggesting employment-only metrics understate AI-era career disparities. The wage compression ($-4$\%) and satisfaction decline ($-18$\%) for Graphic Designers---driven by creative autonomy loss and skill-identity erosion---present a starker picture than the near-zero employment change implies.
