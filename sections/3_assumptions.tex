\section{Assumptions and Justifications}

Our model rests on carefully considered assumptions grounded in empirical evidence or theoretical necessity. Table~\ref{tab:assumptions} summarizes all assumptions with sensitivity classifications.

\subsection{Key Assumption Details}

\paragraph{A4: Logistic Adoption.} AI adoption follows $dA/dt = \kappa_A A(1 - A/A_{\text{cap}}) - \lambda_{\text{cong}} A \rho$, where the congestion term is our novel extension capturing verification-induced slowdowns.

\paragraph{A5: Verification Bottleneck.} Human verification capacity is finite; when AI output volume exceeds bandwidth, congestion emerges. Evidence: software code review bottlenecks, medical AI ``alert fatigue,'' creative industry quality degradation.

\paragraph{A6: Multi-Channel Learning.} Workers acquire AI skills through: (1) on-the-job learning (proportional to usage), (2) social/peer learning (network effects), and (3) autonomous self-study (AI-assisted tutoring).

\subsection{Robustness}

Sensitivity analysis (Sec.~9) relaxes key assumptions: alternative adoption curves (S-curve, Gompertz, linear), labor supply elasticity $\epsilon_L \in [0.1, 0.5]$, and enrollment inertia $\tau \in [1, 4]$ years. Conclusions remain robust within reasonable parameter ranges.
