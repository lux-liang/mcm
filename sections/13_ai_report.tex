\subsection*{Usage Summary}

\textbf{Literature Review}: AI assisted in summarizing papers; all citations verified independently.

\textbf{Mathematical Modeling}: Core TECM framework developed independently; AI provided suggestions evaluated by team.

\textbf{Code Development}: Python code developed with AI completion; all code reviewed and validated.

\textbf{Writing}: Initial drafts by team; AI provided grammar/style suggestions.

\subsection*{Human Oversight}

All AI suggestions subject to: (1) factual verification against sources; (2) mathematical validation; (3) code testing; (4) editorial review.

\subsection*{Declaration}

We certify that core intellectual contributions (problem formulation, model design, analysis, recommendations) are original team work. AI tools were used as assistive technologies, not primary authors. We comply with all MCM/ICM rules.
