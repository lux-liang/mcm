\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{AI Usage Report}

Per MCM/ICM guidelines, we document AI tool usage:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item \textbf{Claude 3 Opus}: Literature summarization (citations verified independently), code debugging, LaTeX formatting assistance.
\item \textbf{GitHub Copilot}: Python simulation code completion (all code reviewed and validated by team).
\item \textbf{Grammarly Premium}: Grammar and style checking for final draft.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Human Oversight}: All AI outputs subject to factual verification, mathematical validation, code testing, and editorial review. Core intellectual contributions (problem formulation, TECM framework design, analysis, recommendations) are original team work. AI tools served as assistive technologies, not primary authors.
